Send notifications from BMC Control-M to Slack

## Getting Started

You will need access to your Control-M/Server to be able to copy files over to the OS.  You'll also need access to modify the Shout Destination table.

Copy the appropriate files out of \windows or \linux into the directory of your choice to your Control-M/Server.


## Motivation

Slack is where everyone hangsout nowadays.  So let's make it easier to get information from our critical production systems into it!

## Installation
