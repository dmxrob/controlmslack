Send notifications from BMC Control-M to Slack via Shout

## Getting Started

You will need access to your Control-M/Server to be able to copy files over to the OS.  You'll also need access to modify the Shout Destination table.

Copy the appropriate files for \windows or \linux into the directory of your choice to your Control-M/Server.  Setup a shout destination referencing the program.


## Motivation

Slack is where everyone hangs out nowadays.  So let's make it easier to get information from our critical production systems into it!

## Installation

###Windows
Make sure curl is installed. Copy the bat file to a scripts directory on your Control-M/Server.
###Linux
Make sure curl is installed. Copy the bash script to a scripts directory on your Control-M/Server.
